PokéVest
PokéVest would be a comprehensive app designed for Pokémon collectors and investors, allowing users to track the performance of their Pokémon card and sealed product portfolios. The app would feature tools to input and monitor collection value over time, providing insights like percentage growth, recent sales data, and market trends. It would also include a "Trending Cards" section that showcases hot cards in the market, highlighting price changes and demand indicators, similar to CNBC’s stock ticker but tailored to Pokémon collectibles. Additional features could include news on upcoming product releases, a marketplace for buying and selling, and educational content on investing in Pokémon products. This app would bridge the gap between casual collectors and serious investors, offering a fun yet professional platform for the Pokémon investment community.
